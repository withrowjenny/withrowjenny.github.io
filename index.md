I am a PhD candidate in economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My doctoral research examines the role of gender in rural-to-urban migration and family formation during the U.S. farm crisis of the 1920s and 1930s, focusing on the intersection of race and class. Using both large scale census data (in the form of linked men and women over two decades) and qualitative sources such as  oral histories, I explore the mechanisms that drove female rural-to-urban migration during the early twentieth century.
